 ### Images:

 The 3dPrinter.jpeg image is a free to use image i found on google images. I have not altered the image from it's original state, but have renamed it for easier storing and searching in my folders. The Licance for this image can be found at <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TOSY_Parallel_Robot.JPG">commons.wikimedia.org</a>. The use of this image is for education purposes and will not be used commercially.

 I found the welding image on google images with the search setting set to display all images that could be use for none commercial reuse. The image comes from <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/123237">pxhere.com</a> As mentioned in the site this images is from, no attribution is required but i felt it was best to do so anyways.

 The scrap.jpg image was found the same way as the welding one, but this image belongs to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HSS_Twist_Drill_into_Aluminium_with_Lubricant.jpg">JJ Harrison</a>. All rights to the image belong to Mr Harrison. The only change that has been made is the name it is saved as to make it easier to find in the images folder.

 My cnc image for this project is also a none attribution required image from <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/771478">pxhere.com</a>.
